# Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-for-MNIST

Recongition of handwritten content is very popular in today's world. Keeping this in mind, 
my project partner and I decided to develop a digit recognizer for the popular MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. 

Approach:
  We have approached this problem with the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN). 
  We have used multi-layers to unravel this complication and also KERAS is the API that is used for implementing the neural networks.

Training and Testing:
  We trained a classiÔ¨Åer that is able to identify a digit after being trained on tens of thousands of such handwritten images. 
  The multilayers are connected to visualize the output. 
  The result shows the confusion matrix, accuracy curve and the loss curve.
